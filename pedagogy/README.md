#### 3. Instructional Strategy
###### Name of Instructional Strategy  :    <u> Expositry
###### Assessment Method: Formative Assessment

<u> <b>Description: </b> Instructional Strategy will be implemented in the simulator as follows: </u>
<br>
 The simulator has a package of lab apparatus like voltmeter, ammeters, rheostat, dc generator-motor set, induction motor, circuit breaker, wattmeter, relay and wires. In the first part of simulator, the student will able to understand the lab instruments, their symbol and explain their function. In the second part of simulator, the student will ready to do an exercise to identify the instruments.

#### 4. Simulator Interactions:
<br>

Sr.No | What Students will do? |	What Simulator will do?	| Purpose of the task
:--|:--|:--|:--:
1.| Student will open the experiment window.  <br> | Display the simulator window for familiarization of the electrical machine laboratory apparatus. <br> |To identify the lab apparatus.
2.| Student will select the apparatus by the mouse cursor. <br>  | Select the apparatus for the study. <br>  | To choose the correct lab apparatus as per knowledge by user.
3.| Student will explain the concept of lab apparatus and define their function. <br>  |  Display the details about the apparatus.<br>  |To understand concept of selected lab apparatus and also define their application.
4.| Student will match the correct apparatus with their symbol. <br>  | Apparatus move from one block to another block. <br>  | To check the user knowledge by performing the experiment.
5.| Student will submit their task by click on submit button. <br>  |  Simulator will submit the completed task by user.<br>  |To save the task for future reference.
