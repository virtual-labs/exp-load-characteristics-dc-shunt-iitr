#### 3. Instructional Strategy
###### Name of Instructional Strategy  :    <u> Expositry
###### Assessment Method: Formative Assessment

<u> <b>Description: </b> Instructional Strategy will be implemented in the simulator as follows: </u>
<br>
 The simulator has a package of lab equipments like voltmeter, ammeters, rheostat, dc generator-motor set and wires. Firstly, the user has to understand the equivalent circuit of experiments and make proper connections to complete the circuit as per the given instructions. After making the right connection, the user can ready to take a reading from ammeter, voltmeter to by change the load at the generator terminal These observation readings are plotted the generator terminal voltage vs load current.
